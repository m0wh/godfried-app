# Godfried Sequencer

> Desktop app for https://mowh.fr/godfried

This project of voluntarily surprising and counter-intuitive sequencer aims to stimulate creativity prioritising musical research instead of mechanical composition.

Godfried Toussaint is a Canadian researcher of McGill University who discovered that Euclid's algorithm (used to find the greatest common divisor between two numbers) could also be used to generate the rhythms present in most styles of World Music. 

The sequencer brings inspiration and creativity not only by allowing the composer to experiment both in nature and during daily commutes in the metro, but it also pushes people to **find ideas manipulating** instead of manipulating having an idea.
